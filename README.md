# VALORANT Agent Yoinker
A VALORANT tool for instalocking agents using the VALORANT API (Updated to include Deadlock/TDM maps).

# How to Use
**MAKE SURE VALORANT IS OPEN BEFORE RUNNING AGENT YOINKER.** Launch VALORANT and then run the program. Enter your region and agents you want to instalock.

# How it Works
Agent selecting is handled via the VALORANT API, which means that this program does not mess with the game's memory or files at all to select the agent. It just sends a request that an agent has been selected when in the pregame state.
